Story for under 20

You’re at home in bed, about to go to log off facebook when your phone vibrates on the deck next to you. You pick it up and you have a message from someone on tinder. You unlock your phone and it’s that hot (CHICK/GUY) that matched with you for reasons unknown. They’re super-hot and obviously super horny at the moment and you’ve been chosen! The message says they want to meet up…”Now!” its 11:45pm, your parents have been asleep for a while now, and you’re sure that you can get out of your window with no worriers. But, you’ve got to get up early tomorrow to get to class on time.
#Should you sneak out to fuck this hottie?
Yes/No

NO:
You lock your phone and crawl into bed hoping that tomorrow’s class is worth it because you may have passed up the best fucking of your life!

YES:
You respond that your keen and they send you the address to meet at. You’re now dressed and out on the quiet street, following the directions.
When you reach the destination it’s a shady looking park then you see a figure on a bench and you’re 80% sure it’s them.

GIRL:
He stands up and starts walking towards you. The 20% of you is shitting themselves, but you walk towards him.
 “Hey <Name> is that you?” he calls from the distance his voice is deep.
 “Yeah” you respond quiet hesitantly.
 “It’s me Ben. You DTF?” 
Although you’re a little taken by surprise, you continue to walk towards him and ignore his straight forwardness. “Yeah definitely” you’re finally standing right in front of him.
“Cool” he grins as his arms wrap around your back just above your butt. He kisses you. It's awesome to say the least. It almost doesn’t feel real.
He explains how his parents are out of town and he want to take you back to his.
#Do you want to take up his offer?
Yes/No

NO:
“OK” he says a little disappointed “that’s fine I can understand how you could see that as dangerous. Message me when you’re ready for me”. He kisses you on the cheek. You go home. Pussy. Wasting every ones time. “Im such a Fuck head”.

YES:
You follow him to his place. It’s decent. You make your way to his room.
